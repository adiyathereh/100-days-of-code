# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [Salesman's Travel challenge on Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56af1a20509ce5b9b000001e). Completed it with writing tests 

**Thoughts:** I learned about regex. Specifically learned how to call the constructor function of the RegExp object and how to compose them from variables.

### Day 2: July 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Continued looking into react following the freeCodeCamp course. Learned about states, props, events 

**Thoughts:** I start getting how the bind method works. Actually quite happy that I could reproduce the Form exercise from scratch.
